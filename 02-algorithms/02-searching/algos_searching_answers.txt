1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
   would it take to find the value G using linear search?
      7

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
   would it take to find the value G using binary search?
      3

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
      a. If 1 is the 1st fibonnaci number and 1 is the 2nd fibonnaci number then the
      tenth, eleventh and twelfth fibonnaci numbers are 55, 89, and 144.
      b. If 1 is the 0th fibonnaci number and 1 is the 1st fibonnaci number then the
      tenth, eleventh and twelfth fibonnaci numbers are 89, 144, and 233.

4. Compare the time it takes to run fib(20) between the iterative solution from the
   previous checkpoint and recursive solutions.
                        user     system      total        real
      Iterative:    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000003)
      Recursive:    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000958)

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
   between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive
   solution? Explain your reasoning.
      I am assuming that I cannot sort the items first. Since, binary search only
      works on sorted items I would use linear search. Based on my benchmark results
      I would use an iterative solution, because it seems to be much faster.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
   between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive
   solution? Explain your reasoning.
      I would use binary search because it eliminates half of the items on each iteration.
      Based on my benchmark results I would use an iterative solution, because it seems
      to be much faster.
