1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
      line.rb allows developers to store the data in an array and manipulate the data using the class
      methods. pixel.rb will generate a pixel based on the data passed in when generating a new instance
      of the class.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
      For line.rb a developer would use the search method. for pixel.rb a developer could search for a
      pixel using the x and y coordinates.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
      An array can represent anything that needs to be stored in a specific order like a message board
      ordering post by newest. pixel.rb would work for any data that needs to be retrieved using a key
      like the x,y coordinates. An example would be retrieving a user based on their email.
