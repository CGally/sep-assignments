1. Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
      Each time the computer reads from Ram it will grab a range of data and place it in the
      cache. Doubling the size of the array when a collision occurs will lead to exponential
      growth and bigger gaps between data in the array. So if there are big gaps in the array,
      when the computer grabs the data from the RAM, it will be grabbing only small portion of
      the needed data. This will lead to more reads which will lead to a decrease in performance.
